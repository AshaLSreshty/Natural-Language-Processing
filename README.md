Quora Insincere Questions Classification: A sentiment analysis using machine learning approaches

Social media has been a virtue as well as an
annoyance. It has enabled intellectual interactions among people
all around the world and is also vulnerable to influencers, who
use the platform to perpetuate toxic behavior through social
media. Quora, which is a crowd sourced platform, is not devoid
of this menace. Many social media intruders took advantage
of uninhibited online interactions to spread hatred through
their ideals like racism, sexism, homophobia, and other plethora
of nuisance. Moderation of these unrestricted posting of toxic
content in Quora, requires employing efficient machine learning
model to detect and cull-out negative posts even before reaching
the wide readership, while promoting only positive posts. In this
present work, we have applied machine learning approaches
on the dataset of questions provided by Quora and obtained
from Kaggle. Natural language processing was done to deploy
various machine learning models for toxic comment classification.
The whole work flow included data cleaning, exploratory data
analysis, feature extraction, using pre-trained word embeddings
and various supervised classification models to identify the
negatively influencing posts. The accuracy of the models was
evaluated through confusion matrix and F1-score. Of the many
approaches tried and implemented such as Logistic Regression,
Naive Bayes (Mulitnomial,Bernoulli), Random Forest Classifier,
XGBoost Classifier, SGD Classifier and Linear SVM models,
the most significant results were demonstrated by the classical
Logistic regression model with minimal data preprocessing. The
F1 score of the model was found to be 0.63
